# DeepFDR
Proposed Model: Spatial FDR controlling approach based on Deep CNN

Evaluation:

Model 1 - Nearest-neighbor homogeneous HMRFs

Model 2 - High-order-neighborhood non-homogeneous HMRFs

Model 3 - Short-/long-range and graph-based spatial dependencies

DL - W-Net based self-supervised segmentation model

Run using pip:
```
pip install venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
